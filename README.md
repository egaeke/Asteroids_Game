## About
This is the repository for my Asteroids game based off of a tutorial video by DerekBanas on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWuU5ly0taA&list=LL&index=3&ab_channel=DerekBanas

### What I Did
I expanded upon the basic framework of the game from the tutorial by adding custom ship and asteroid sprites as well as created a hyperspace function that will teleport the ship to any location on the screen. I also created a website using GitHub Pages and published my game at https://egaeke.github.io/egaeke_Asteroids/.

### Controls: 
W,A,S,D to move,
Space to shoot,
Shift to use hyperspace

### Instructions:
This game is based off the classic Asteroids game where the goal is to shoot as many asteroids down as possible while avoiding crashing into them. You have three lives with a new one added with each level cleared. There is also a hyperspace function that teleports you randomly to any point on the screen (including inside of asteroids so use it as a last resort!). You only start with one hyperspace use and they can only be obtained when you clear a level.
