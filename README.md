This is the repository for my Asteroids game based off of a video by DerekBanas on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWuU5ly0taA&list=LL&index=3&ab_channel=DerekBanas

Controls: 
W,A,S,D to move
Space to shoot
Shift to use hyperspace

Instructions:
This game is based off the classic Asteroids game where the goal is to shoot as many asteroids down as possible while avoiding crashing into them. You have three lives with a new one added with each level cleared. There is also a hyperspace function that teleports you randomly to any point on the screen (including inside of asteroids so use it as a last resort!). You only start with one hyperspace use and they can only be obtained when you clear a level.
